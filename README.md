<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Ece! 👋</h1>
<h2 align="center"> 👩🏻‍💻 About me 👩🏻‍💻</h2>

I am a software developer with a strong foundation in Java, and basic knowledge of C++, Python, MySQL, and LaTeX. During my studies, I worked on various academic projects, including a Dart and Google Firebase-based graduation project, which helped me apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world development.

I am currently focused on learning and improving my skills in Spring Boot and backend technologies to build more efficient applications. I am passionate about learning new tools and technologies and excited to apply my knowledge in future projects.

🚀 Open to new opportunities.
📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn or check out my projects on GitHub.
